NAME
    Test::Script - Highly cross-platform basic tests for script

DESCRIPTION
    This module is experimental and may not perform as advertised... yet

    API may change in future without notice

    YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED

    The intent of this module is to provide a series of basic tests for
    scripts in the bin directory of your Perl distribution.

    Further, it aims to provide them with perfect platform-compatibility and
    in a way that is as unobtrusive as possible.

    That is, if the program works on a platform, then Test::Script should
    also work on that platform.

    In doing so, it is hoped that Test::Script can become a module that you
    can safely make a dependency of your module, without risking your module
    not working on some platform because of the dependency.

    Where a clash exists between wanting more functionality and maintaining
    platform safety, this module will err on the side of platform safety.

FUNCTIONS
  script_compiles_ok
      script_compiles_ok( 'bin/foo', 'Main script compiles' );

    The "script_compiles_ok" test calls the script with "perl -c
    scriptname", and checks that it returns without error.

    The path it should be passed is a relative unix-format script name. This
    will be localised when running "perl -c", and if the test fails, the
    local name used will be shown in the diagnostic output.

    Note also that the test will be actually done with the same perl
    interpreter that is running the test script (and not with the default
    system perl). This will also be shown in the diagnostic output on
    failure.

TO DO
    - Make this work properly

    - This module does not itself have tests

    - Test on as many platforms as possible
